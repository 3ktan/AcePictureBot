# AcePictureBot

## How can I add to a list?

If you know Git feel free to create a pull request.

Or you can simply fill in this form:

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QS3RxcMXskYlvGleSX4sXvOwnnD3m4dsc_sO9JmeCtM/viewform?c=0&w=1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QS3RxcMXskYlvGleSX4sXvOwnnD3m4dsc_sO9JmeCtM/viewform?c=0&w=1)

## Why am I limited?

Limits are here for many reasons.

I want every command (shipgirl, touhou, etc.) to always include an image. These image sites have their own limits.

Twitter also has a limit on how many tweets you can do every hour.

## What are the current limits?

Limits change all the time.

You can ready the current set of limits (in hours) here:

[settings.ini](https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/blob/master/settings.ini)


## Why can I only do MyWaifu twice?

The MyWaifu limit is low as it is to help you not go through all their images in a week.

Not doing this will only increase the chance of seeing the same image.

## No MyWaifu image

To make sure you don't see the same image twice, if it can't get a new image it will simply fail.

That includes if the website the images are taken from is offline or it failed in some other way.

Try again later.

If this continues to happen for a long time there is a high chance that your waifu has no more new images.

Wait some seasons or re-register your waifu to get a fresh start.

## No images where found

The person you searched for didn't seem to have any images.

Most of the time "No Images" is from a mistake on your end.

Look at the examples again.

Make sure to spell their name correctly and don't include the series name unless specified.

## Not enough images where found

Simply this. Not enough images where found with the name you said.

This can sometimes happen from spelling their name another way.

If it's common for your character to have more than one name, try the others.

## Why do I have to follow to register

Saving yours and everyone else's data is a lot overtime.

## Can I register more than one waifu

No. Don't be a slut. Stick with your one waifu.

## My account is not genuine

Your Twitter account isn't active enough.

There are too many one-off accounts that only use the command once.

This leads to a lot of pointless files and text hanging around.

If you are a genuine account or don't want to use your main account and want to register; feel free to contact: @AceStatusbot

## Let me Register a OTP, Idol, etc.

**No**, this bot is for images not text. Your "OTP" will probably have no more than 1 image.

You can register a Idol by using WaifuRegister.

## Why is the WaifuRegister time limit so high?

People are sluts and don't stick with one waifu and so they change it every time the limit is over and get any image they want.

**PLEASE GO TO GOOGLE.COM FOR THAT!** If you messed up on registering then you should look at the examples more.

## None of the commands are working for me!

* Is the bot online?
* Are you not just limited?
* Did you check @AceStatusbot?
* Did you register something on the "DO NOT REGISTER" list?
* Did you unfollow twice while still having a waifu registered?

If you think it's none of these feel free to contact: @AceStatusbot

Feel free to tweet @AceStatusbot

## MyWaifu for Discord and Twitch Chat

First you will have to register your waifu (or husbando) on Twitter.

Follow the [first command listed here](ace3df.github.io/AcePictureBot/commands/).

### Connecting on Discord

Private message the bot on Discord with MyWaifu (or MyHusbando) - the bot will reply with a code.

Tweet to @AcePictureBot using the command "DiscordConnect" followed by your code.

Example: @AcePictureBot DiscordConnect a2bc3f

You will get a reply telling you it has connected.

If your code is invalid simply message the bot on Discord again.

### Connecting on Twitch IRC

Head on over to [mywaifu.acebot.xyz](mywaifu.acebot.xyz) and click "Connect your Twitter Waifu to Twitch!"

You will sign into Twitter and then your Twitch.

You can disconnect both apps after you have logged in.


### Troubleshooting

Tweet your problems to [@AceStatusBot](http://twitter.com/acestatusbot).
