# AcePictureBot

### How can I add to one of the command's lists?

If you know Git feel free to create a pull request.

[Or you can simply fill in this form!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QS3RxcMXskYlvGleSX4sXvOwnnD3m4dsc_sO9JmeCtM/viewform?c=0&w=1)

### Why am I limited?

Limits are here for many reasons.

I want every command (shipgirl, touhou, etc.) to always include an image. These image sites have their own limits. Twitter also has a limit on how many tweets you can do every hour.

### What are the current limits?

Limits change all the time.

You can ready the current set of limits (in hours) here:

[settings.ini](https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/blob/master/settings.ini#L20)


### Why can I only do MyWaifu twice?

It's best to always see a new image when using MyWaifu.

If there isn't a limit you will see them all pretty fast.

You can use MyWaifu+ to get a random image which includes already used ones.

You can also use MyWaifu- to clear your personal "Used MyWaifu Images" and get a fresh start.

### No MyWaifu image

To make sure you don't see the same image twice, if it can't get a new image it will simply fail.

This includes if the websites the images are taken from are having problems.

Try again later in the day.

If this continues to happen for a long time (i.e. a full week) there is a high chance that your waifu has no more new images.

Wait some seasons or use MyWaifu- to get a fresh start.

### No images where found

The bot couldn't find any images from the name you used.

Most of the time this can be that you spelt their name wrong or in another way compared to what the websites use.

You can try to read a list of already used names here: [Waifu](https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/blob/master/lists/Waifu%20List.txt) | [Husbando](https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/blob/master/lists/Husbando%20List.txt)

Make sure to spell their name correctly and don't include the series name unless specified.

### Not enough images where found

Not enough images where found with the name you said.

You can wait some seasons for said person to grow more fan art.

This can sometimes happen from spelling their name another way from what websites use.

If it's common for your character to have more than one name, try the others.

### Why do I have to follow to register

Saving yours and everyone else's data is a lot overtime.

### Can I register more than one waifu

No.

### My account is not genuine

Your Twitter account isn't active enough.

There are too many one-off accounts that only use the command once.

This leads to a lot of pointless files and text hanging around.

If you are a genuine account or don't want to use your main account and want to register; feel free to contact: @AceStatusbot

### Let me Register a OTP, Idol, etc.

**No**, this bot is for images not text. Your "OTP" will probably have no more than 1 image.

You can register any Idol by using WaifuRegister.

### Why is the WaifuRegister time limit so high?

People are sluts and don't stick with one waifu and so they change it every time the limit is over and get any image they want.

**PLEASE GO TO [GOOGLE.COM](https://google.com) FOR THAT!**

If you messed up on registering then you should look at the examples more.

### None of the commands are working for me!

* Is the bot online?
* Are you not just limited?
* Did you check [@AceStatusbot](http://twitter.com/AceStatusbot)?
* Did you register something on the "DO NOT REGISTER" list?
* Did you unfollow twice while still having a waifu registered?

If you think it's none of these feel free to contact: @AceStatusbot
