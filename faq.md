## Why am I limited?

Limits are here for many reasons. 

I want every command (shipgirl, touhou, etc.) to always include an image. These image sites have their own limits, along side Twitter's API. 

## What are the current limits? 

Limits currently change all the time as I am not finished with the bot. Just don't go crazy and you should be fine.

## Why can I only do MyWaifu twice?

After a lot of testing and watching people complain about getting the same image, the science and maths all add up to 2 being the best number to take every waifu/husbando into account with their average user usage to image count.

## Let me Register a OTP, Idol, etc.

**No**, this bot is for images not text. Your "OTP" will probably have no more than 1 image. 

You can regiser a Idol by using WaifuRegister.

## Why is the WaifuRegister time limit so high? 

I originally had this idea for people to get images of their waifu quickly. People are sluts and don't stick with one waifu and so they change it every time the limit is over and get any image they want. 

**PLEASE GO TO GOOGLE.COM FOR THAT!** If you messed up on registering then you should look at the examples more. I'm usally fair; if I see that my bot didn't help much I will personally remove the limit and help you. 

## Why do I have to register to use MyWaifu? 

How is the bot suppose to know your waifu? Using "MyWaifu" is NOT the same as "Waifu". 

## None of the commands are working for me!

* Is the bot online?
* Did you register something on the "DO NOT REGISTER" list?
* Did you unfollow twice while still having a waifu registered?
* Are you not just limited?

If you think it's none of these feel free to contact me.

## "Not enough images were found!"? 

People use MyWaifu a lot. No more than 10 images were found on 2+ sites. It is pointless to keep a person that doesn't have images for a image based command. Try again after some seasons or just get a better waifu. You can also try spelling their name another way.

## "No images were found!"?

Simple, no images were found. That or you spelt their name wrong.

## Why "Ace [blank] Bot"? 

I couldn't think of any other name. 

## How do I request a feature?
