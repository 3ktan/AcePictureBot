### Donations
[PayPal](https://paypal.me/ace3df)

[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ace3df) (Monthly)

**Please only donate if you want to support the commands part of the bots and not for the images posted.**

As the bot grows and spreads out (Twitter, Discord, IRC) it becomes more demanding to serve on each service in real-time.

AcePictureBot has been [getting updated basically daily](https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/commits/master) for the last year and from it - the bot can only get bigger.

I want to make sure that it is on a stable server and is running at all times without a bump.

You can make a one time donation through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/ace3df) or if you're committed enough you can also donate monthly through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ace3df) and receive special roles and stuff on each project!

Thanks for your support, feel free to tweet @Ace3DF
