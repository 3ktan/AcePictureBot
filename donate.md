### Donations
I will now start to accept donations through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/ace3df) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ace3df).

Currently I share a server with a friend and that limits my access to the hosting company and more. For the bot I want to make sure that it is on a stable server and is running at all times. 

You can make a one time donation through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/ace3df) or if you're committed enough to care about what I do, you can also donate monthly through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ace3df).

Donation funding will also support additional Twitter Bot projects, such as a simple way to create and host your own.

Thank for for your support, feel free to tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/ace3df">@Ace3DF</a>
