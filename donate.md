### Donations
[PayPal](https://paypal.me/ace3df)

[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ace3df) (Monthly)

Please only donate if you want to support the commands part of the bots and not for the images posted.

As the bot grows and spreads out (Twitter, Discord, IRC) it becomes more demanding to serve on each service in real-time.

For the bot I want to make sure that it is on a stable server and is running at all times without a bump.

You can make a one time donation through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/ace3df) or if you're committed enough, you can also donate monthly through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ace3df) and receive special roles on each project!

Donation funding will also support additional projects, such as a simple way to create and host your own Twitter bot!

Thank for your support, feel free to tweet @Ace3DF
