<strong class="blink">WARNING:</strong>
Anyone asking about or sharing information related to illegal activities
will be banned from IRC/GitHub/etc.

**The IRC channel is used exclusively for development related topics.**
Before joining to ask a question, make sure it's not already answered in the
[FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq/).

If you have *development related questions* or want to watch the progress of
the emulator, join up to `#xenia-dev` on freenode. For non-development chatting,
use [#xenia on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23xenia) instead.

You can use the web chat, however note that most of us have day jobs and will
not be able to answer right away. Hang out and we'll be around eventually.
