## How can I help?

There are 3 ways you can help with lists!

Please note that you have to understand how the lists are layed out - names are changed to fit with what they will be searched for on sites like Danbooru and Sankaku. Last name followed by First name **not** First Last.

<div>Last Fist||Anime Name</div>

If you want to add to the Waifu/Husbando list you will have to lay it out like so:

<div>Last First||Anime Name||MyAnimeList Profile Image</div>

## What list can I add to?

Any list!

## Getting the right name

First go to [chan.sankakucomplex.com](http://chan.sankakucomplex.com)

Change the name from First Name to Last_Name. This will search the correct name.

If you don't get any images look at the common tags from that search or try just searching for the series they're from, find a image they are in and then look at the tags for that image.

## How do I add to the list?

You can either create a pull request on Github or just contact me on Twitter [@Ace3DF](http://twitter.com/ace3df)
