## Wah! Slow down! (Twitter only)

Some Patreon users go crazy with "MyWaifu 2" which will simply use up all their waifu's images quickly.

This *warning* - **not limit** - is only to give you a heads up to slow down. You should calm down a bit.

## I'm a new Patreon, why do I need to wait until the the 1st of the next month?

Per Patreon's advice it's best to wait until your first billing before giving off Patreon rewards.

## Limited Idol/OTP Register

This is easy to abuse so it is limied on what you can register.

If you don't see an Idol or OTP that you would like to register suggest it in a Patreon message.

For Idols - use this list and search for people under the 'idol' list!:
 
Waifu: [https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/blob/master/Configs/Waifu%20List.yaml](https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/blob/master/Configs/Waifu%20List.yaml)

Husbando: [https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/blob/master/Configs/Husbando%20List.yaml](https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/blob/master/Configs/Husbando%20List.yaml)

For OTP use one of the valid ones here: [https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/blob/master/Configs/OTP%20List.yaml](https://github.com/ace3df/AcePictureBot/blob/master/Configs/OTP%20List.yaml)

Copy the whole line (not including the last ":"). I.e. "@AcePictureBot OTPRegister Hiei (Kantai Collection)(x)Kongou (Kantai Collection)"
