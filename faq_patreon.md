## Wah! Slow down! (Twitter only)

Some Patreon users go crazy with "MyWaifu 4" which will simply use up all their waifu's images quickly.

This *warning* (not limit) is to just give you a heads up to slow down. You should calm down a bit.

## I'm a new Patreon, why do I need to wait until the the 1st of the next month?

Per Patreon's advice it's best to wait until your first billing before giving off Patreon rewards.
